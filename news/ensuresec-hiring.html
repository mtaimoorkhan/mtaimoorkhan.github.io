<h1 id="well">Post-doctoral Research Fellows in cyber security of e-commerce and delivery service ecosystem (ENSURESEC project)</h1>
<p><strong>The project <strong>ENSURESEC</strong> is starting from June 1, 2020 and formal advertisement for these positions will be announced in coming weeks. Considering short time left in the start of the project, the intent of this pre-announcement is to catalyse the selection process by spreading the message to interested candidates timely.</strong></p>
<p>We have two positions for the post-doctoral research fellows to work in the EU HORIZON 2020 project <em>&ldquo;ENSURESEC: </em><em>End-to-end Security of the Digital Single Market&rsquo;s E-commerce and Delivery Service Ecosystem&rdquo;</em>. ENSURESEC is a sociotechnical solution for safeguarding the Digital Single Market&rsquo;s e-commerce operations against cyber and physical threats. It combines an automatic, rigorous, distributed and open-source toolkit for protecting the e-commerce infrastructure, with monitoring of the impact of threats in physical space. ENSURESEC addresses the whole gamut of modern e-commerce, from standard physical products purchased online and delivered via post, to entirely virtual products or services delivered online. Similarly, it addresses threats ranging from maliciously modifying web e-commerce applications or rendering them unavailable to legitimate customers, to delivery issues or fraud committed by insiders or customers. It achieves this by focusing on the common software and physical sensor interfaces that sit along the e-commerce, payment and delivery ecosystem. At a technical level, it integrates proven state-of-the-art inductive (machine learning) with deductive (formal methods) reasoning tools and techniques so that e-commerce operations are protected by design, as well as through continuous monitoring, response, recovery and mitigation measures at run-time.</p>
<p>These are exciting opportunities to participate in a new area of research and in the process collaborate with our prestigious project partners, including key players in software engineering, software verification, blockchain, pen testing, telecommunication, electronic financial services, social media, cyber and physical security of critical infrastructure, to name a few.</p>
<p>Within the project, you will be responsible for developing a run-time security monitor (<b>position 1</b>) and a tool for software recovery (<b>position 2</b>). The former will be required to translate and adapt existing monitors for the security of e-commerce system. The latter will be required to develop a tool for detection and recovery of software from threats and errors. The tools are required to be open source and free. This research will be expected to be published at a premier related journal.</p>
<p>You will need to be a highly competent software developer with experience in developing cyber security tools, ideally in the context of run-time security, software security or vulnerability/fault analysis as well as have high-impact research publications in related areas. A PhD in computer science, mathematics or engineering is essential.</p>
<p>Since these posts are project based, they are <strong>fixed term</strong> for two years.</p>
<p>You may wish to contact <strong>Dr. M. Taimoor Khan</strong> (<a href="mailto:m.khan@gre.ac.uk">m.khan@gre.ac.uk</a>) for informal enquiries.</p>
