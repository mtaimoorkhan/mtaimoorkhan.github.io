<h4 id="funding">Funding : H2020</h4>
<h4 id="duration">Duration : 2021-2024</h4>
<h4 id="role">Role : Co-I</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">RESCUER aims to design and develop an FR-centered technology toolkit that will empower the next-generation of First Responders by enhancing their operational capacity and safety, specifically in adverse conditions, both environmental and infrastructure-wise.
RESCUER will deliver a toolkit offering (1) sense augmentation through enhanced sensorial input, (2) precise and infrastructure-less self-positioning, (3) cognitive support and multi-sense AR interfaces, improving their focus and capability to utilise information and (4) robust ad-hoc intra-team communications for both verbal and data exchanges, all delivered over enhanced power and communication autonomy features. Extending the above capabilities, through the concept of a building black box, RESCUER will also introduce the capability of extracting environment information “in situ and infrastructure-wise”, during a disaster.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> The project is funded by H2020 and costs approx. 8 Mio &euro;. For current activities of the project, please visit <a href="https://rescuerproject.eu" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<h4 id="funding">Funding : H2020</h4>
<h4 id="duration">Duration : 2020-2022</h4>
<h4 id="role">Role : P.I.</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">ENSURESEC will be a sociotechnical solution for safeguarding the Digital Single Market’s e-commerce operations against cyber and physical threats.
It provides an automatic, rigorous, distributed and open-source toolkit for protecting the e-commerce infrastructure, with monitoring of the impact of threats in physical space and a campaign for training SMEs and citizens aimed at creating awareness and trust. It addresses the whole gamut of modern e-commerce, from standard physical products purchased online and delivered via post, to entirely virtual products or services delivered online.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> The project is funded by H2020 and costs approx. 10 Mio &euro;. For current activities of the project, please visit <a href="http://ensuresec.eu" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<h4 id="funding">Funding : HEIF (Higher Education Innovation Fund) UK</h4>
<h4 id="duration">Duration : 2021-2021</h4>
<h4 id="role">Role : Co-I</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">The proposed project aims to provide a study on the emerging legal-tech industry, addressing the legal and technical aspects of innovative data-driven tools in the legal profession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"> The project is funded by HEIF UK and costs approx. 25K £. For current activities of the project, please visit <a href="#">here</a></p>
		
 <h3 id="armet">Runtime Security Monitoring</h3>
<h4 id="funding">Funding : MIT CSAIL and QCRI</h4>
<h4 id="duration">Duration : 2016-2018</h4>
<h4 id="role">Role : Lead I.</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">The goal of the project was to develop a system which allows target applications to continue rendering useful services even after successful (known or unknown) attack happens. The project is lead by Howard Shrobe (AIRE research group) and is an extension to AWDRAT middleware which is funded by DARPA's SRS (Self-Regenerative System) program. The motivation here is that today' cybersecurity tools are very limited as they are retrospective (i.e. catch things we have already seen) and focus on individual exploits instead of complex and multi-stage full campaign of an APT.</p>

<h4 id="funding">Funding : FWF, Austria</h4>
<h4 id="duration">Duration : 2009-2014</h4>
<h4 id="role">Role : Project Assistant</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">In this project, we have developed a novel framework for the formal specification and verification of MiniMaple programs and its application to a non-trivial program package. MiniMaple is a substantial subset of the language of the computer algebra system Maple; in contrast to Maple (which is dynamically typed), we have equipped MiniMaple with a static type system. The main goal of the thesis is the application of light-weight formal methods to MiniMaple programs (annotated with types and behavioral specifications) for finding internal inconsistencies and violations of methods preconditions by employing static program analysis. This task is more complex for a computer algebra language like Maple as it supports non-standard types of objects and also requires abstract data types to model algebraic concepts and notions. As a starting point, we have defined and formalized the syntax, semantics, type system and specification language for MiniMaple. For verification, we automatically translate the annotated MiniMaple program into (a semantically equivalent program in) the intermediate language Why3ML of the verification tool Why3; from the translated program, Why3 generates verification conditions whose correctness can be proved by various automatic and interactive theorem provers (e.g. Z3 and Coq). Furthermore, we have defined a denotational semantics of MiniMaple and proved the soundness of the translation with respect to the operational semantics of Why3ML. Finally, we discuss the application of our verification framework to the Maple package DifferenceDifferential developed at our institute to compute bivariate difference-differential dimension polynomials using relative Groebner bases.<br />

<h3 id="dk10"><a href="https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/910x3g3.pdf" target="_blank">Formal Verification of Space Mission Communication Protocols</a></h3>
<h4 id="funding">Funding : University of Leicester, UK</h4>
<h4 id="duration">Duration : 2007-2008</h4>
<h4 id="role">Role : Project Assistant</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">This research was carried out in the frame of project "Space Link Extension Service Management", which was sponsored and run by various space agencies, e.g. NASA, USA. The goal of the project was to study the (space mission communication protocols) specification documents provided by NASA and to
<ol>
<li>find ambiguities and inconsistencies in the requirements of the protocols</li>
<li>devise a unified protocol resolving the identified ambiguities</li>
<li>specify the behavior of the proposed protocol and finally</li>
<li>to verify various properties of the protocol, e.g. absence of dead-lock and information inconsistencies.</li></ol><br />
